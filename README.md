# Responsive Portfolio

Personal Portfolio Built with Bootstrap CSS Framework and Employing Responsive Design 

## Information

USER STORY - Client requested a mobile-responsive portfolio consisting of three pages: About, Portfolio, and Contact.
Example images were provided, illustrating the arrangement of each page when viewed from small, medium, and large viewports.

In building my three pages, I have learned the fundamentals of using Bootstrap and the importance of resposive design. I have a much greater appreciation for how websites are presented on screens of various sizes.

Knowledge and Resources Used
- My classes
- I referred to Nathan's portfolio that he shared with us as an example
- W3Schools
- Bootstrap documentation

There is much I wish to improve upon:
- Refine all elements
- Tweak all layouts
- Learn more about Bootstrap code I imported & delete segments that do not apply to my pages (I have already removed some things)
- Apply my own styles to all pages
- Import fonts and utilize them
- Resize pictures so they are the same
- Improve this readme
- Get a better handle on using GitHub
- Resolve the two below-listed issues
- Learn and utilize the appropriate way to cite resources (I think there may be special code for this, too)

Issues
1) The size of index.html does not look the same as the portfolid.html and contact.html pages; this is especially noticable when viewing the navbar. I must determine what is causing this and fix it.
2) I ran my html through a validation service (https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html). It cited an errorr on the porfolio.html page, line 90, which reads: <figcaption>Bríghe</figcaption>
I suspected the error occurred due to the Irish character "í". When I experimentally replaced it with the English character "i", the error message was removed. However, as "í" renders properly on the webpage, I decided to retain it so that the name "Bríghe" would be intact. I am guessing I need to load or link to Irish characters.
